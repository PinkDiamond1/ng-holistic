<h1>Custom columns definition map</h1>

<p>
    According to <a [routerLink]="['/ddux']">Domain Design</a> principles in order to make application implementation
    more robust hence easier to implement and understand, we should define some domain model and operate it inside our
    application.
</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
    In context of this library this means following:
    <li>
        First of all we define the set of common column types specific for the application (we could call it domain
        model of the app).
    </li>
    <li>
        For each column type we implement specific component associated with it, for example there is could be
        CardNumberColumnComponent which display card number and icon of the card's scheme (visa / master / etc), or some
        PersonColumnComponent which will display highlighted name of the user and popup which will show additional user
        info. These components should be developed by design team and verified by business domain experts.
    </li>
    <li>We configure link between column type and associated component.</li>
    <li>
        After this we could use these column types in any table definition across whole application just describing this
        column in table definition object. So when domain expert asks developer to add column with CardNumber type to
        some table there is no ambiguity how it should be done and what UI to use for this.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you application has some custom component which supposed to be used repeatedly in the cells of the various tables
    you could use configurable map for custom columns. `TMapColumns` is the generic parameter which passed
    TableDefinition class and has default value of `Table.MapColumns.Column = LinkColumn | ImgColumn;` This column
    definition provides interface to insert into the cell arbitrary predefined components. By default there is defined 2
    custom mapped columns `LinkColumn | ImgColumn`. You could extend predefined set of `TMapColumns` and then use their
    definitions inside any table definition.
