            <td>id</td>
            <td class="left">
                Identifier of the generated input control, id plays crucial role in form's binding, this property will
                be automatically created on formGroup and input's value binding will be sync; all changes on the input
                control will be reflected on the formGroup and vice versa, if generated control implements
                <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor" target="_blank"> ControlValueAccessor </a>
                interface.

                Type of the generated control, there is number of the <a href="#">most common controls</a> already
                included in the library, you could <a href="#">add any custom component</a> to be generated on the form.

            <td>props</td>
            <td class="left">
                Contains set of values for generated component's Input properties. In the example above 'placeholder'
                property exists on the component associated with TextField kind, so the component 'placeholder' property
                will be initialized from value of the 'props.placeholder' field. 'label' property exists on the
                <a href="#">control wrapper</a>, so it also will be initialzied from here.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>validators</td>
            <td class="left">
                Contains array of regualr angular validators to be applied to the generated form control, works the same
                way as in standard 'FormGroup' control initialization. Also this value could be observable with the same
                array of validators as emitted value, this case control validators will be updated accordingly to the
                emitted value.

        <tr>
            <td>hidden</td>
            <td class="left">
                Observable - hide / show control on the form, when controls is hidden it value will be removed from
                formGroup automatically. See example <a href="#" [routerLink]="['/clr-forms/form-recalc']">here</a>.

        <tr>
            <td>value</td>
            <td class="left">
                Observable - define the current value of the control, the way to implement form fields values
                recalculation. See example <a href="#" [routerLink]="['/clr-forms/form-recalc']">here</a>.
