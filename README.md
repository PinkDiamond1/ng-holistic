# Ng-Holistic

This solution is umbrella for number of angular libraries which makes development of data driven applications faster.

There is 3 major topics which this solution is intended to help.

1. Data driven forms
2. Data driven tables (TBD)
3. Utils (TBD)

## Data driven forms

### Overview

The target here is to create angular forms declaratively now matter how simple or complex they are.

These should support following scenarios:

1. Create forms by declaring them via js structure.
2. Sync form controls / UI components values via standard DataValueAccess interface.
3. Sync any input / output property of the components with one from declarations, supporting both scalar and observables.
4. Hide / Show components via observable declaration property.
5. Set component validations via declaration property, both scalar and observable.
6. Set of the controls generated by declaration must be unrestricted, configurable and expandable, so doesn't depended on any UI library.
7. Ability to create arbitrary control groups such as tabs, groups, etc, again unrestricted, configurable and expandable.
8. Support custom components inside definition with all benefits of regular ones.

> Note: there is ready to use library based on [clarity](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/) UI design system with predefined set of components.
