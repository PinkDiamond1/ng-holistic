<h2>Reasoning</h2>

<p>
    The purpose of this library is allow developers to create components (forms in particular) not by implementing them
    with html, styles and code but by describing (defining) them. Then it is concern of the UX library to generate these
    components, this way we effectively separate core (business) logic of the application from the UI implementation.
</p>

<h2>Forms</h2>

<p>
    With help of this library you define (describe) forms. Theses forms then will be generated with library;
    <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControl" target="_blank">FormControl</a> will be created for each defined
    field automatically and its value will be bound to the
    <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/FormGroup" target="_blank">FormGroup</a> value. Though library has
    <a href="#">default set</a> of the most common inputs, you could always
    <a [routerLink]="['/clr-forms', 'form-extra']">extend</a> this set by configure additional inputs which then could
    be used across the whole application, also there is a way to include in form definitions custom field definitions
    which then would be bound to the particular component in template. Any custom component in case it implements
    <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor" target="_blank">ControlValueAccessor interface</a> and
    added to the form definition will got the same capabilities as the default ones.
</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>
    The major benefits from using this library could achieve large data driven applications with a lot of forms. 
    Using this library you could easily and reliable describe desired form representations without concern how
    inputs will be rendered and bound to the form value. Library provides strict set of API (aka description DSL) 
    to render UI components, this allows large teams to stay sync on how to create and use forms inside application, no need to copy / paste html
    css code when create new components or invent some base classes which abstracts common forms implementation for the
    application.
