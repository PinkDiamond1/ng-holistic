<h1>Custom columns definition map</h1>

<p>
    According to <a [routerLink]="['/ddux']">Domain Design</a> principles in order to make application implementation
    more robust hence easier to implement and understand, we should define some domain model and operate it inside our
    application.

    >Example
</hlc-sbx-example-link-button>

<ul>
    In context of this library this means following:
    <li>
        First of all we define the set of common column types specific for the application (we could call it domain
        model of the app).
    </li>
    <li>
        For each column type we implement specific component associated with it, for example there is could be
        CardNumberColumnComponent which display card number and icon of the card's scheme (visa / master / etc), or some
        PersonColumnComponent which will display highlighted name of the user and popup which will show additional user
        info. These components should be developed by design team and verified by business domain experts.
    </li>
    <li>We configure link between column type and associated component.</li>
    <li>
        After this we could use these column types in any table definition across whole application just describing this
        column in table definition object. So when domain expert asks developer to add column with CardNumber type to
        some table there is no ambiguity how it should be done and what UI to use for this.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data binding</h2>

When we use custom component inside the cell we must bind values from row to the input properties of the component.
There is two ways to do it:

<h3>Binding via props</h3>

Every custom column definition object has 'props' property which used to bind row value to component input properties.
The 'props' object is hashmap with keys equal to component's input property names, the values of this hashmap must be binding fumnctions
which given value of the column and the row should return value supposed to be bound to this component property.


<h3>Binding via component default value property</h3>
If custom component define some input property annotated with <i>@HlcDefaultBindValue</i> attribute, this property will be bound to the cell value implicitly
so you don't need to bind it manually via 'props'.

<h2>Output events binding</h2>
