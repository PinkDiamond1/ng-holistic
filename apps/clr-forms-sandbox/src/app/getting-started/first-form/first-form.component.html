Here we create form with single text input. There is three most important properties of the field which define generated
input control.
<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>id</td>
            <td class="left">
                Identifier of the generated input control, id plays crucial role in form's binding, this property will
                be automatically created on formGroup and input's value binding will be sync; all changes on the input
                control will be reflected on the formGroup and vice versa, if generated control implements
                <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor" target="_blank"> ControlValueAccessor </a>
                interface.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>kind</td>
            <td class="left">
                Type of the generated control, there is number of the <a href="#">most common controls</a> already
                included in the library, you could <a href="#">add any custom component</a> to be generated on the form.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>props</td>
            <td class="left">
                Contains set of values for generated component's Input properties. In the example above 'placeholder'
                property exists on the component associated with TextField kind, so the component 'placeholder' property
                will be initialized from value of the 'props.placeholder' field. 'label' property exists on the
                <a href="#">control wrapper</a>, so it also will be initialzied from here.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Set rendered component properties from Observable</h3>

As demonstarted above every @Input() property on the rendered component could be initialzied from the property with the
same name on 'props' field of the form definition object. There is another feature, it is possible to use not just
scalar value for initialziation of the components properties but 'observale' stream, which case the component
property will be updated every time when stream emits some value.
