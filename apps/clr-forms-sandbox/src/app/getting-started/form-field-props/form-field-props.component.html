            <td>id</td>
            <td class="left">
                Identifier of the generated input control, id plays crucial role in form's binding, this property will
                be automatically created on formGroup and input's value binding will be sync; all changes on the input
                control will be reflected on the formGroup and vice versa, if generated control implements
                <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor" target="_blank"> ControlValueAccessor </a>
                interface.

                Type of the generated control, there is number of the
                <a [routerLink]="['/inputs-list']">most common controls</a> already included in the library, you could
                <a [routerLink]="['.', 'custom-form-field']">add any custom component</a> to be generated on the form.

        <tr>
            <td>props</td>
            <td class="left">
                Contains set of values for generated component's Input properties. For example 'placeholder'
                property exists on the component associated with TextField kind, so the component 'placeholder' property
                will be initialized from value of the 'props.placeholder' field. 'label' property exists on the
                <a [routerLink]="['..', 'form-field-wrapper']">control wrapper</a>, so it also will be
                initialized there.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>label</td>
            <td class="left">
                Convention property, the same as props.label, since supposedly each field definition will have 'label'
                property and it would be inconvenient to define each time it in props object.

            <td>validators</td>
            <td class="left">
                Contains array of regular angular validators to be applied to the generated form control, works the same
                way as in standard
                <a href="https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators" target="_blank">FormGroup control initialization</a>.
                Also this value could be observable with the same array of validators as emitted value, this case
                control validators will be updated accordingly to the emitted value.
